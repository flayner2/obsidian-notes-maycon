# Experiments
- Compare the mTOR $CpG_{O/E}$ values of *A. mellifera* and ants (or an ant);
	- Are those genes significantly more methylated in the bee?
- Compare ants with solitary bees (and/or sawflies or solitary wasps);
- Compare *A. rosae* with another solitary species (bee, wasp or sawfly, or one of each), maybe trying to look for one with a similar $CpG_{O/E}$ distribution.

# Interesting discussion points
- *D. melanogaster* has a left-shifted median $CpG_{O/E}$ value (with $m \approx 0.87$);
- Two solitary wasps, *F. arisanus* and *D. alloeum* have low median $CpG_{O/E}$ values ($m \le 0.79$);
	- They are both from the family Braconidae, subfamily Opiinae;
		- They are bot parasites and apparently with specific hosts from the fruit fly family Tephritidae;
	- There's one other Braconidae in this set, *M. demolitor*, not from the same subfamily, and whose median $CpG_{O/E}$ value is $\approx 0.95$;
		- This species is also a parasite, but seems to target specifically species from the order Lepidoptera;
	- All of the above facts could account for the lower median $CpG_{O/E}$ in *F. arisanus* and *D. alloeum* being due to a common evolutionary origin (a phylogenetic signal, and not an evidence of common function);
- Even though the median $CpG_{O/E}$ in *C. cinctus* is lower than in *A. cephalotes*, the mTOR pathway genes are enriched among the overmethylated genes in the ant compared with the sawlfy (comparing the $log_2$ difference of $CpG_{O/E}$ values between both)
