- Uploaded the probe files to LGM;
- Generated alignments with `swat` and uploaded the results to LGM;
    - All gap penalty scores were set to `-5`;
    - Two polynucleotide probes of 500bp were used: a poly-A and a poly-T probe;
    - The alignment matrix assigns a score of `1` for matches, `-2` for missmatches and `0` for matches against `N` or `X`;
    - Matches to ambiguous bases were considered mismatches;
- Started working on a parser for the alignment files;
- Finished most of the parser logic for both the `.allscores` and `.alignments` files;
- Pushed the code to the `dev` branch of the `git` repo.
