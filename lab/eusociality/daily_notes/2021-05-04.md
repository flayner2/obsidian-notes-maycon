- Did a test run with the entire mitogenome pipeline using a different *Apis mellifera* SRA dataset, with mapQ quality thresshold = 30;
- Found out the issue with the CAFE5 input files and fixed it (`dos2unix`). Unfortunately, CAFE5 is memory intensive and I can't run it locally, so I'm waiting for Chico's clearance to put it on LGM and run it there;
