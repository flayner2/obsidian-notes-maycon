- Generated counts for the contigs that appear only once and those that appear more than once in the alignments bed files;
- Updated `blast_2_bed` to not add the occurrence counts to the contig name, as it was causing issues with `bedtools` and utilities like `uniq`;
- Uploaded the new results to LGM and sent an e-mail to Chico;
- Updated the `git` repos acconrdingly.
