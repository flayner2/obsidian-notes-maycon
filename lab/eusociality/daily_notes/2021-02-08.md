- Created visualizations for summary statistics for the vector-masked EST data;
    - Made several corrections to the statistics calculation code and to the Jupyter Notebook;
- Updated the `git`repo accordingly, which is available [**here**](https://github.com/flayner2/lab_data_analysis);
    - While on that, found a way to [**visualize the Jupyter Notebooks online**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/flayner2/lab_data_analysis/blob/master/notebooks/analyze_vector_masking_data.ipynb).
