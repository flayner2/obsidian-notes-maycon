- Finished the Rust program to convert BLAST alignment `tsv` files to BED files;
- Converted the alignments for the clusters (both `cap3` and `phrap`) to BED files using the new program;
- Added the program to the `lab_utils` repository;
- Updated both repos accordingly;
- Uploaded yestarday's and todays BED files to LGM;
- Fixed a small issue with `blast_2_bed`;
    - Updated both repos accordingly;
    - Updated the local installation;
    - Updated the results and uploaded the new results to LGM;
- Installed `bedtools` locally;
    - Ran `bedtools intersect` on the genome and clusters files for each species, for each clustering program (`cap3` and `phrap`);
    - Uploaded the results to LGM;
    - Ran it again, now saving the features that do not overlap with any gene region;
    - Uploaded the new results to LGM.
