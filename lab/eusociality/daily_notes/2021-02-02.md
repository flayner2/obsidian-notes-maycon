- Added date stamps as the `date_added` variable for all entries in the metadata spreadsheet;
- Checked [**Time Tree**](http://www.timetree.org/) for a possible tree accounting for the old and new annotated species;
    - 25 names were unresolved: the tree isn't good enough;
- Created a script to filter sequences from a FASTA file by their length;
