- Generated the metadata files for CALANGO;
	- The following command was used to order the fields from the metadata sheets and calculate the log10 of the number of individuals to later paste to the metadata `tsv` file:
```bash
awk -F'\t' 'OFS="\t" {print $2, $5, 1 + (log($5)/log(10.0)), $6, $4, $1, $3}' ind_counts.txt > data_formatted.txt
```
- Generated the Pfam dictionary file;
```bash
grep "\sPfam\s" ~/eusociality/results/interpro_results/2021-09-07/*tsv | awk -F"\t" '{OFS="\t"}{print $5, $6}' | sort | uniq > pfam_dict.tsv
```
- Generated the CALANGO parameter files.
