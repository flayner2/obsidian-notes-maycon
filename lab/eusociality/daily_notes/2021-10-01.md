- Continued getting new genes for the phylogeny:
	- 30174at7399: **tell Zé about GCF 001272555 for this gene, 'cause there's a gap at 3' that seems to be dividing a stop codon**;
	- 17918at7399;
	- 19564at7399;
	- 23621at7399;
	- 5779at7399.
- Updated the "names to ids" file;
- Renamed the genes in the alignments;
- Exported the `.nex`, `.phy` and `.tsv` files with SequenceMatrix;
- Created the PartitionFinder configuration file;
- Uplodaded all the files to LGM and sent them to Zé and Chico via email;
- Fixed the `partition_finder.cfg` file;
- Ran PartitionFinder on LGM:
```bash
nice -n 10 python ~/eusociality/bin/partitionfinder-2.1.1/PartitionFinder.py -p 50 partition_finder/
```
