- Used `betools` with the `-wo` flag to generate BED files for the alignments containing the overlap size as well.
- Uploaded those results to LGM;
- Started working on a script to convert a BED file for these alignments + a FASTA file (to get the original contig length) into a `tsv` file with coverage information;
- Updated the `git` repo accordingly.
