- NCBI are annotating the following genomes:
	- [*Aphidius gifuensis*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid684658[orgn]);
	- [*Apis laboriosa*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid183418[orgn]);
- Asked Chico about what should we do, but he didn't answer, so I decided to wait for NCBI to finish annotating those genomes;
- Worked on the paper's manuscript.
