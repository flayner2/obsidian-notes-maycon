- The tree for 44 Hymenoptera finished running. Topology looks ok, but there are some issues with the support values of some nodes;
- Rooted the tree using FigTree and transformed it into an ultrametric tree using the R package `ape`:
```R
#R
library(ape)

tree <- read.nexus("tree_rooted.nex")
ultra_tree <- compute.brtime(tree)
write.tree(ultra_tree, file = "tree_ultra.nwk")
```
- Ran CALANGO using the 44 Hymenoptera parameters and tree, just to have a hint from preliminary results:
```R
#R
library(KOMODO2)

output <- run_KOMODO2(defs = "parameters_gene2go.R")
```
- Fixed the script `concat_genes.py` for Alison;
- Did some updates to the paper's manuscript.
