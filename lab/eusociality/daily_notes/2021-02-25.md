- Created a wrapper in the "main" script to remove polynucleotide sequences by their z-score and distance to `XGroups`;
- Created a wrapper in the "main" script to remove `XGroups` by sequence class;
- Created a function to save intermediate result files;
    - We need those files to run `swat` again, now with some removed regions, to find new alignments that could potentially be trimmed;
    - Those intermediate files need not to be kept, but we'll keep them for now as intermediate results. They will be loaded again by the "main" script for further processing;
- Ran the "main" script and produced the intermediate files for an extra round of alignments;
- Created a function and a class method to clear the old alignments for the `ESTSeq` objects;
- TODO: we need to load the new alignments but first we need to update the parser to account for broken cases such as when there are no alignments at all.
