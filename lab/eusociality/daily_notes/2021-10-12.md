- MrBayes finished running. Tree topology looks good, but some run parameters are suboptimal so let MrBayes keep running with 100mi more generations by giving it the "append=yes" option;
- Rooted the tree with FigTree and exported the rooted tree;
- Made the tree ultrametric with `ape` using:
```R
library(ape)
read.tree("hymenoptera_52_tree_rooted.nwk")
ultra <- compute.brtime(tree)
write.tree(ultra, "hymenoptera_52_tree_rooted_ultrametric.nwk")
```
- Uploaded the ultrametric tree to LGM;
- Installed the lastest version of CALANGO locally on LGM;
- Created the dictionary file for Pfam:
```bash
cd /home/maycon/eusociality/data/dicts/2021-10-12
mkdir tmp
cp ~/eusociality/results/interpro_results/2021-09-07/*.tsv tmp/
cp ~/eusociality/results/interpro_results/2021-09-20/*.tsv tmp/
cp ~/eusociality/results/interpro_results/2021-09-23/*.tsv tmp/
cp ~/eusociality/results/interpro_results/2021-09-24/*.tsv tmp/
cp ~/eusociality/results/interpro_results/2021-09-29/*.tsv tmp/

grep "\sPfam\s" tmp/*tsv | awk -F"\t" '{OFS="\t"}{print $5, $6}' | sort | uniq > pfam_dict.tsv

rm -rf tmp
```
- Updated the parameter files for CALANGO (made all the paths to the input files, metadata files, folders, etc. relative);
- Ran calango:
```R
library(CALANGO)
output <- run_CALANGO(defs = "parameters_gene2go.R")
```
- Found a bug in CALANGO when generating the HTML report, will open an issue on Github to inform;
- In the meantime, ran KOMODO2 testing for rooted and unrooted trees:
```R
library(KOMODO2)
output <- run_KOMODO2(defs = "parameters_gene2go.R")
```
- Found out that rooted vs unrooted makes a big difference in the results and that rooted is preferred.
