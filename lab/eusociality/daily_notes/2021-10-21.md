- Fixed the issue with CAFE's running times: it has to deal with the large variability of gene counts for certain gene families. There are two proposed ways to get rid of this issue:
	1. Remove families with the largest variance (or standard deviation);
	2. Remove families with the largest difference between the highest and the lowest count;
- Tested removing families based on variance (made an R script for that, which is on LAB in `/home/maycon/eusociality/bin/utils/remove_high_variance_families.R`). Here's what I've got:
	- My data has a small bunch of families with extremely high variance (> 1000), even some with tens or hundreds of thousands variance ammounts;
	- Removing the families with a variance level above the 75th quantile gets rid of 1345 families, and CAFE runs smoothly, fast, and is able to calculate the best $\lambda$ value;
	- Removing only the families with very extreme variance levels (> 10k) gets rid of 3 families, and CAFE does run, but very slowly and isn't able to calculate the best $\lambda$ because of precision underflow;
	- Removing the families with a variance level above the 99th quantile gets rid of 54 families, and CAFE runs a bit slowly (but not so slow) and is able to calculate the best $\lambda$ value;
- These experiments use our old data and the entire Hymenoptera tree with 34 species. Finding the best cutoff value for the variance will depend on the dataset. For this dataset, the 99th quantile seems to yield a good balance between removing high variance and keeping data;
- It is also worth testing for the other ranking variable, $max - min$, to see if it works best (but probably not because variance and standard deviation are more standard ways to identify large ammounts of variation in the data);
- Tested with 99th percentile for multiple lambdas (2 lambdas, separating bees from the rest) and it worked flawlesly.
