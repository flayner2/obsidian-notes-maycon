# 2021-02-23

- Fixed the loading of the alignments (didn't even know it was broken lol);
- Fixed the function that sets the alignments for each ESTSeq object;
- Improved the overall speed of the code by making both `set_masked_seqs_for_ESTSeqs` and `set_alignments_for_ESTSeqs` quite faster;
- Found an issue on how alignments and their positions are loaded: need to fix this urgently;
- Created a function to trim polynucleotide subsequences and a wrapper for a usecase of that function;
    - Need to document and create tests for both;
- Updated the `git` repo accordingly.
