# 2021-02-24

- Reorganized the folder structure of the entire repo;
    - This was done primarily to fix import issues;
- Fixed the issues with the `swat` alignment files parser;
- Documented and refactored the subsequence trimming function and its wrapper;
- Created the `estseq.py` script to hold the `ESTSeq` and make it available to other scripts inside `helpers`;
    - Removed the `ESTSeq` definition from the "main" script;
- Fixed how the alignments are set to their corresponding `ESTSeq` objects in the "main" script;
    - This was done to conform to the new way we parse the alignments files;
- Moved all the test scripts to the `helpers` folder to facilitate imports;
- Updated the `XGroup` removal tests in `test_filter_seqs.py` to conform to the new data model;
- Created two new tests in `test_filter_seqs.py` to test the functions `trim_subsequence` and `trim_polynucleotides_by_dist_to_xgroups` from `filter_seqs.py`;
- Updated the `git` repo accordingly.
