- Ran PartitionFinder for the first codons-removed dataset:
```bash
nice -n 10 python ~/eusociality/bin/partitionfinder-2.1.1/PartitionFinder.py -p 50 partition_finder_codons_removed_1/
```
- The run for the full dataset completed. Downloaded it and sent the result to ZÃ©;
- Checked the genes from the protein-guided alignment with MAFFT:
	- 45168at33392 - ok, loses stop codon;
	- 75072at33392 - trimmed the 3' end;
	- 67937at33392 - trimmed the first codon at 5' (because of *Aros* only);
	- 65545at33392 - trimmed 5' end;
	- 73136at33392 - ok;
	- 87096at33392 - trimmed 5' and a big block at 3';
	- 75566at33392 - trimmed 5';
	- 89570at33392 - trimmed the first codon at 5';

	- 47016at33392 - trimmed 5' and 3' ends;
	- 81580at33392 - trimmed 3' end;
	- ~~33501at33392~~ - doesn't exist anymore;

	- 56574at33392 - trimmed 5' end and a large portion of the 3' end;
	- 86363at33392 - trimmed first codon at 5' and a big chunk of the 3' end;
	- 61724at33392 - trimmed a large portion of the 5' end, trimmed the 3' end, and there's a large indel at near 3' in GCF_012274295 and GCF_004153925;
	- 100935at33392 - trimmed the 5' end and the last codon at 3';
	- 60560at33392 - trimmed big chunks of the 5' and 3' ends;
	- 114758at33392 - trimmed a decent chunk at 5';
	- 116109at33392 - trimmed 5' and 3' ends, alignment at 5' is not great and has many gaps, but they're all multiple of 3 and translation is fine;
