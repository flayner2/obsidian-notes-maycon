- Tested the mitogenome pipeline with two species this time: *Polistes fuscatus* and *Bombus pyrosoma*, because they have very small file sizes (<2Gb for the raw FASTQ files from SRA);
	- Not removing the raw FASTQ and SAM files so I can work with them and test some things later;
	- Using a mapQ thresshold of 20 only on samtools, not on BWA;
	- Will test:
		- Filtered files (mapQ >= 20, only propper pairs, mapped to mitogenomes);
		- Semi-filtered files (not using the mapQ filter);
			- The filtering step worked for *Polistes fuscatus*, but not for *Bombus pyrosoma*, but the assembly was bad anyways;
		- Unfiltered files (the raw FASTQ files from SRA);
			- This last test might not work locally because of MitoZ's large RAM footprint;
			- It didn't work.
