- Fixed some parameters in the parameter files for CALANGO;
- Tried to run CALANGO again but fell into the same bug as before. Finally openned the [issue on Github](https://github.com/franciscolobo/KOMODO2/issues/8);
- Downloaded the CALANGO input and parameter files to try and run it locally, to see if the issue is somewhat related to running it on the server;
	- It wasn't, since the same error was thrown when running on my PC. Found two links that might be useful reference:

- Ran KOMODO2 on LGM for all proxies, for GO and Pfam, and downloaded the results locally;
- Received the `partition_finder.cfg` file from ZÃ© with the data blocks definitions for dataset 1, updated the data blocks names and uploaded to LGM with the alignments and matrices generated on [[2021-11-01]];
- Ran PartitionFinder for dataset 1:
```bash
nice -n 10 python ~/eusociality/bin/partitionfinder-2.1.1/PartitionFinder.py -p 50 partition_finder_dataset_1/
```
- Got the data for dataset 2 and uploaded it to LGM;
