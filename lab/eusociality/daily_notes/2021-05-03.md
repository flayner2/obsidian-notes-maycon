- Did a test run with the entire mitogenome pipeline using a lower mapQ cuttoff (20), but the results were unexpected:
	- It yielded a smaller ammount of filtered reads;
	- The MitoZ results were comparable to the previous ones;
- Rewritten part of the script since I accidentally lost some of it;
- Downloaded and installed CAFE5 locally, reworked the input files and tried to run it, with no success.
