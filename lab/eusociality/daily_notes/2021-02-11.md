- Created the script `filter_seqs.py` and updated the Jupyter Notebook to iterate through and filter all sequences based on their sequence class, which is based on the presence and characteristics of its x-groups;
- Added a test script for `filter_seqs.py`;
- Converted the sequence filtering workflow from the Jupyter Notebook into a standalone Python script, `filter_ests_by_masked_vectors.py` and ran it, producing the expected output files;
- Updated the `git` repo accordingly;
- Uploaded the results to LGM.
