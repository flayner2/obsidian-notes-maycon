- Ran PartitionFinder for the second codons-removed dataset:
```bash
nice -n 10 python ~/eusociality/bin/partitionfinder-2.1.1/PartitionFinder.py -p 50 partition_finder_codons_removed_2/
```
- The run for the first codon-bases-removed dataset completed. Downloaded it and sent the result to ZÃ©;
- Checked the genes from the protein-guided alignment with MAFFT:
	- 89570at33392 - ok;
	- 118220at33392 - trimmed the first codon at 5';
	- 116590at33392 - ok;
	- 37660at33392 - trimmed the 5' and 3' ends;
	- 105333at33392 - trimmed 5' and a big chunk of 3';
	- 87633at33392 - trimmed a large portion of 5', trimmed the 3' end;
	- 68602at33392 - trimmed 5' and a big chunk of 3';
	- 61549at33392 - trimmed large portions of the 5' and 3' ends;
	- 74309at33392 - trimmed a large portion of 5', trimmed 3';
	- 87827at33392 - trimmed the 5' and a large portion of 3';
	- 95275at33392 - trimmed the 5' and 3' ends;
	- 24031at33392 - trimmed a large portion of 5', trimmed 3';
	- 112028at33392 - ok;
	- 61826at33392 - trimmed the 5' and 3' ends;
	- 79473at33392 - trimmed 5' and 3';
	- 47016at33392 - trimmed 5' and a large block at 3';
	- 81580at33392 - trimmed 3' end;
	- ~~33501at33392~~ - doesn't exist anymore;
	- ~~59339at33392~~ - internal region with low-quality alignment, removed;
	- 56574at33392 - trimmed 5' end and a large portion of the 3' end;
	- 86363at33392 - trimmed first codon at 5' and a big chunk of the 3' end;
	- 61724at33392 - trimmed a large portion of the 5' end, trimmed the 3' end, and there's a large indel at near 3' in both species of *Osmia*, a large indel at 3' in all three species of *Bombus* and a smaller indel at 5' in all 5 species of social wasps (*Polistes* + *Vespula*) - will keep all the indels;
	- 100935at33392 - trimmed the 5' end and the last codon at 3';
	- 60560at33392 - trimmed big chunks of the 5' and 3' ends;
	- 114758at33392 - trimmed 5';
	- 116109at33392 - trimmed 5' and 3' ends, alignment at 5' is not great and has many gaps, but they're all multiple of 3 and translation is fine;
	- 56271at33392 - trimmed a large portion of 5', trimmed 3';
	- 123921at33392 - trimmed 5';
	- 100122at33392 - trimmed the 5' end;
	- 107482at33392 - trimmed 5', trimmed 3';
	- 14326at33392 - there's a large indel at 5' in *Venturia canescens*, but is multiple of 3, a smaller one further downstream of 5' in *Trichogramma pretiosum*, and a smaller one around the middle in *Tribolium castaneum*, also there's a region with a bunch of gaps near 3' but they're all multiple of 3 - didn't trim anything on this one;
	- ~~122669at33392~~ - internal stop codon in *Habropoda laboriosa*, removed;
	- 43062at33392 - trimmed a large portion of the 5' end, and trimmed the 3' end;
	- 43658at33392 - trimmed a large portion of the 5' end, and trimmed the 3' end;
	- 124625at33392 - trimmed 5' and 3' ends;
	- 122095at33392 - trimmed 5' and the last codon at 3', there's a decent indel near 5' in *Habropoda laboriosa*;
