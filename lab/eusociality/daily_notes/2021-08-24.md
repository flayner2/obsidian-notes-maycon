- Created a script to download information about the Orthologs used and ran it;
- Checked the result file for high evolutionary rate buscos using:
```bash
tail -n +2 buscos_complete_in_44_ortodb_info.tsv | LC_ALL=C sort -t "     " -g -r -k3,3 | less -S
```
- Downloaded the alignments to evaluate with MEGA;
- Selected 31 high evolutive rate genes. Began selecting low evolutive rate ones.
