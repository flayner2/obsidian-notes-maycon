- All of the following steps were executed inside LGM:
    - MAKER with trained Augustus finished running in 38:33:15h;
    - Last step is training GeneMark:
        - Ran `nice -n 10 time perl /usr/local/bin/gmes_linux_64/gmes_petap.pl --ES --cores 50 --sequence data/raw/GCF_003254395.2_Amel_HAv3.1_genomic.fna` to train GeneMark for an eukaryotic genome (`--ES` flag) on the *Apis mellifera* genome. Input is just the raw assembled genome file. Took 41:30m;
        - Changed the MAKER options, adding `gmhmm=/home/maycon/eusociality/work/maker_annotation/2021-04-01/data/gmhmm.mod`;
        - Ran MAKER again with `nice -n 10 time maker`;
- In labbioinfo:
    - Fixed some of the input files for CAFE.
