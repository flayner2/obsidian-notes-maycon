- Worked on some data visualizations for the *Apis mellifera* MAKER2 result analysis;
- Integrated MitoZ into the mitogenome annotation pipeline, while fixing some comments and improving some of the steps;
- Ran a local test for MitoZ on the *Apis mellifera* SRA dataset, to see if the previous filtering steps reduce the memmory needs;
	- Added support for a second run using the multi-kmer mode since the first run yielded very bad results;
		- Created a Python script to generate some intermediate input files necessary for the second run;
		- Found an error while running, has something to do with the `found_genes.txt` file. Need to check this out.
