- Downloaded the new annotated Hymenoptera genomes;
- Removed the `git` repository from the `eusociality` folder since it was taking too much space;
- Ran `extract_ORF.pl` on the newly downloaded genomes;
- Created a `git` repository for the [**LAB util scripts**](https://github.com/flayner2/lab_utils);
- Updated the [**Hymenoptera metadata worksheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bo-lUCDmm_Lqe-GhIzKh_WcJMiR-DkoTCMTieEpWotI/edit?usp=sharing);
    - Changed `color_codes` to `situation_codes` for better compatibility with data utilities and better filtering;
- Finished `get_ests.py`, pushed to the `git` repo and started fetching the sequences on the LGM server;
