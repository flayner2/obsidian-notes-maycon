- Finished the script to find genes in the annotation files. Ran it locally for the 54 genomes of the old species and the new annotated ones;
- Will probably refactor it to change how the outputs are generated and how the input files are formatted and parsed. Will also try to plug in multithreading;
- Updated the `git` repo accordingly.
