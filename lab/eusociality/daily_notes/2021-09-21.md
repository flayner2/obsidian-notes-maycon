- Generated the tabular files from the InterProScan output:
```bash
# for GO
for file in *.tsv; do perl ~/eusociality/bin/KOMODO2/bin/utils/parse_interproscan_output_gene2GO.pl $file /home/maycon/eusociality/work/komodo_inputs/gene2go/2021-09-21/; done

# for Pfam
for file in *.tsv; do perl ~/eusociality/bin/KOMODO2/bin/utils/parse_interproscan_output.pl $file "Pfam" /home/maycon/eusociality/work/komodo_inputs/pfam/2021-09-21/; done
```
- Renamed the files to abide to the names in the tree nodes, using the short names defined in the metadata sheet:
```bash
# from inside the tabular data directory
~/eusociality/bin/utils/./create_renamed_symlinks.sh ~/eusociality/bin/utils/names.txt .
```
- Fixed the renamed-symlink script file and fixed the previously (2021-09-09) generated symlinks because they were broken;
- Counted the features in the tabular files:
```bash
# for GO
for file in *.txt; do perl ~/eusociality/bin/KOMODO2/bin/utils/count_GO_gene2GO.pl $file >> counts.txt; done

# for Pfam
for file in *.txt; do printf "$file" >> counts.txt && tail -n +2 $file | wc -l | awk 'OFS="\t" {print $2, $1}' >> counts.txt; done

# to rename
~/eusociality/bin/utils/./rename_counts.sh ~/eusociality/bin/utils/names.txt counts.txt
```
- Backed up and updated the metadata files in (2021-09-13) with the data for the new species (will use that folder a repository for the metadata files for my Masters);
```bash
awk -F'\t' 'OFS="\t" {print $2, $5, 1 + (log($5)/log(10.0)), $6, $4, $1, $3}' new_5_data.txt > new_5_formatted.txt

paste counts.go new_5_formatted.txt > new_5_go.tsv
paste counts.pfam new_5_formatted.txt > new_5_pfam.tsv

# edited the files to remove uncessary columns and then...
cat metadata_gene2go_44hymenoptera_final.tsv new_5_go.tsv | sort -k1,1 > metadata_gene2go_49hymenoptera_final.tsv
cat metadata_pfam_44hymenoptera_final.tsv new_5_pfam.tsv | sort -k1,1 > metadata_pfam_49hymenoptera_final.tsv
```
- Didn't touch the dictionary file since it became obsolete and I'm still waiting for some annotations to finish.
