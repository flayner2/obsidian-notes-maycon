- Started running Interproscan for all annotated genomes: the original data was from 2019 and early 2020 and our Intreproscan was updated in late 2020, so we thought it was a good idea to generate that data again.
```bash
conda activate interpro
for i in *.fa; do nice -n 10 interproscan.sh -i $i -b ~/eusociality/results/interpro_results/2021-09-07/${i%%.*} -cpu 50 -goterms -iprlookup -verbose > ~/eusociality/results/interpro_results/2021-09-07/${i%%.*}.log; done
```
