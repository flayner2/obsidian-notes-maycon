- Started a manual curation for all genes, updating the sheet as I go;
	- Finished curation for *arginine kinase*;
	- Started for *elongation factor 1-alpha*;
		- Had to stop working on this one since [it is duplicated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9501490/), and although we know [wich copy is usually used for phylogenies](https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-ento-120811-153633), there are some problems in finding the F2 copy for some species in which this information is not precisely annotated;
	- Started for *ultraviolet-sensitive opsin*;
- Ran BRAKER2 again, outside of the *conda* environment, but it threw the same error again:
