- Updated the "names to ids" file;
- Renamed the genes in the alignments;
- Exported the `.nex`, `.phy` and `.tsv` files with SequenceMatrix;
- Created the PartitionFinder configuration file;
- Uplodaded all the files to LGM and sent them to ZÃ© and Chico via email;
- Ran PartitionFinder on LGM:
```bash
nice -n 10 python ~/eusociality/bin/partitionfinder-2.1.1/PartitionFinder.py -p 30 partition_finder/
```
