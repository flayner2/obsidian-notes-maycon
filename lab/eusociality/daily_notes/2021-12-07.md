- Worked in the paper, generating plots and updating data;
- Found out that our sociality levels proxy is a bit too wide, will try a reduced scale with only 4 levels, converting levels 2, 3 and 4 in one, condensed "intermediate sociality" level;
- Created an initial version of the reduced sociality scale, but any attempt to reducing the scale ends up with a very sub-represented intermediate class.
