- Gathered the rRNA sequences for *Apis mellifera*, *Solenopsis invicta* and *Polistes canadensis* to blast against. The sequences are:
    - 5s rRNA, 5.8s rRNA, 12s rRNA, 16s rRNA, 18s rRNA, 28s rRNA, small subunit rRNA, large subunit rRNA;
    - 5s rRNA, 5.8s rRNA, small subunit rRNA;
    - 28s rRNA partial sequence, small subunit rRNA, large subunit rRNA;
- Created the script `filter_seqs_by_blast_expect.py`;
- Filtered the EST sequences by length with `filter_seqs_by_size` and by similarity with rRNA sequences with `filter_seqs_by_blast_expect.py`;
- Installed `phrap/swat/cross_match` on my local machine.
