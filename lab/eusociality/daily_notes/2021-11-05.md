- Continued running KOMODO2 for aculeata (for GO and Pfam, for all other proxies) and downloaded the results;
- Ran CAFE again for the multiple lambdas model to ensure convergence:
```bash
nice -n 10 ~/eusociality/bin/CAFE5/bin/cafe5 -i ~/eusociality/data/pfam_matrices/2021-11-01/pfam_matrix_upto_99quantile_variance.tsv -t ~/eusociality/data/trees/2021-11-01/hymenoptera_52_without_outgroup_ze.nwk -o hymenoptera_levels_52_upto_99th_quantile_4th_run -y ~/eusociality/data/lambda_trees/2021-11-03/hymenoptera_52_without_outgroup_ze_lamda_tree.txt -c 10 -L ../2021-05-04/log.config
```
- Moved the results tables to a Google sheet for better organization and formatting. Updated it with new results.
