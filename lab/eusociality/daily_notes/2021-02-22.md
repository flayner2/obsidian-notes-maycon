# 2021-02-22

- Refactored and documented much of the script `filter_seqs.py`;
- Refactored the master script `process_est_sequences.py`:
    - Refactored the `ESTSeq` object building function;
    - Added new setters for `ESTSeq` objects;
    - Created and optimized a function to load and update the information about vector-masked sequences for an `ESTSeq` object;
    - Created a function to load and update the information about `XGroups` of vector-masked sequences for an `ESTSeq` object;
    - Created a function to load and update the information about alignments for a `ESTSeq` object;
        - Identified that this function is the running time bottleneck: it makes far too many comparisons and takes an unknown, albeit very long time to run. Have to find a way to fix this.
- Updated the `git` repo accordingly;
