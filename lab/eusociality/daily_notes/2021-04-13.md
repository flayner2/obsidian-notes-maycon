- Installed `sra-toolkit` locally on my notebook;
- Downloaded the **[SRA data for *Bombus impatiens*](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR1575230)** for the same BioSample of the genome we're using, locally;
- Used `prefetch` to download the data and `fastq-dump` to convert the SRA file into 2 FASTQ files (with `--split-files`, being one for the forward and one for the reverse read). Up untill here, these are the same steps performed on my PC, described [**here**](2021-04-07%200c81ae8957fa4940a2d1254c85638029.md);
- Installed [**MitoZ**](https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ) locally via a `docker` container;
    - Ran it with the SRA data for *Bombus impatiens* inside the `docker` container with: `python3 /app/release_MitoZ_v2.3/MitoZ.py all --outprefix mitoz --thread_number 4 --fastq1 SRR1575230_1.fastq --fastq2 SRR1575230_2.fastq --duplication --species_name "Bombus impatiens"`
    - Program crashed because of RAM issues. Removed the `swap` partition and created a 50GB `swap` file. Trying once again...
    - Resized the swap file back to 8GB and stopped running. Chico said we will run this on a server instead.
