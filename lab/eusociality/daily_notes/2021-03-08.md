- Performed a series of `blastn` alignments again for the clusters;
    - This time, generated both a `tsv` and a `xml` version of the results, for further parsing;
- Created a Python script to parse and analyze the `xml` alignments;
    - Generated a set of files to summarize the number of sequences the aligned to more than one region of the genomes;
- Sent an email to Chico, describing the procedures so far.
