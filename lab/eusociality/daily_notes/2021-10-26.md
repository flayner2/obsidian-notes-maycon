- The test run with IQtree provided a tree with low bootstrap branch supports. Additionaly, I believe there were issues with the dating implemented in IQtree;
- Did some testing with combining a gene tree, letting IQtree infer the models for each gene, with the species tree, but didn't quite understand the results. Did this for the 42 genes;
- Trimmed all 534 renamed genes with trimal:
```bash
for file in alignments_renamed/*.fas; do trimal -in $file -out trimmed/${file##*/}.trimmed.fas -htmlout trimmed/html/$file{file##*/}.trimmed.html -automated1; done
```
- Exported the alignment matrix and additional files with SequenceMatrix;
- Created a Python script to generate the PartitionFinder codon charset blocks provided the charsets from a NEXUS alignment file (without the `charset` keyword preceding the names);
- Generated the input files for PartitionFinder;
- Ran PartitionFinder locally on my laptop:
```bash
python2 ~/Documents/LAB/eusociality/bin/partitionfinder-2.1.1/PartitionFinder.py -p 4 partition_finder
```
