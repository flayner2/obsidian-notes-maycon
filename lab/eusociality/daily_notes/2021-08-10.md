# 2021-08-10

- Downloaded all the annotated proteomes to run BUSCO locally (both the original ones an the new annotated ones);
- Will run BUSCO locally because the LGM version is very old;
	- [Installed BUSCO using conda](https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#conda-package);
	- Ran BUSCO in protein mode for all annotated proteomes, even those which were previously excluded because of a low BUSCO score (because the new version has new datasets).
```bash
$ conda activate busco
$ time nice -n 10 busco -i /home/maycon/Documents/LAB/eusociality/local_data/proteomes/2021-08-10/all_annotated/ -o hymenoptera_all_annotated -m prot -l hymenoptera_odb10 -c 4
```
