- Ran `cross_match` locally on the rRNA- and length-filtered EST sequences, using UniVec to filter out vector and adapter sequences. Produced a set of `.screen`files which are FASTA files with X's where the sequences identity to a vector sequence is significant;
- Uploaded the local `cross_match` results to the server;
- Created a `jupyter` notebook to summarize the vector-masked data, which allows us to decide which sequences we need to trim, which ones we need to discard and which ones we keep untouched.
