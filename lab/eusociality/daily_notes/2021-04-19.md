- Got the genomes and gene results locally on my PC;
    - Put everything from `local_data` on `$STORAGE/lab_data`;
- Tried to add concurrency to `extract_genes.py` but scrapped the idea;
    - Added a timing decorator that prints a "done" message when execution finishes;
    - Added the example files to the repo and updated the README file;
    - Merged the changes into `master` and pushed to the remote;
    - Updated the `git` repo accordingly.
